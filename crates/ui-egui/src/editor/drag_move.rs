//! FE-7: dragging the selection in a family's plan or elevation moves it, as Revit's does. A press on an element (its edge, a
//! form's face, a plane's trace, a line, a dimension, a connector, a selected symbol's strokes) and a drag past the few points a
//! click allows move the whole selection by the drag, in the view's plane; one not selected is selected first (alone, or added
//! with Ctrl). A lone plane of the family's own keeps F4's drag, through its constraints (`views.rs`).
//!
//! What moves and how: planes, reference lines and forms through the constraints (`family::constraints::Moving`, `move_by`):
//! a form's sketch in its host plane where the view sees it flat; where it sees it edge-on, the part of the drag along the
//! plane's normal moves an extrusion's or a blend's Start and End together; what is locked to what moves follows where the
//! constraints let it, and a lock, a label, EQ or an Align lock to what stays refuses the move, naming it. A nested instance,
//! a symbol and a connector are placed again by the drag; a dimension's line goes with it, never what it measures. Only the
//! numbers that move are written, as numbers: one that is a formula refuses the move. A datum, a plane that defines the
//! origin, what a pivot turns, and what would leave the plane it is drawn on stay, refusing the move. After it every type
//! must still solve and build (as Finish checks), or it is refused. A refusal leaves everything as it was and says why.
//!
//! The drag is the shape handles' (FE-5): made again from the draft as it was at each step (live, one step of the history
//! once the button is up), the pointer read through the view as it was when the drag began; a drag back where it began
//! leaves nothing to save; Escape, Undo, Redo and another view or tab shown give it up, everything put back.
//!
//! FE-4: with Ctrl held, the drag copies the selection instead (`Family::copies`), the copies moved by the same rules and
//! selected in place of what they copy; Ctrl as the button comes up decides between a copy and a move.
