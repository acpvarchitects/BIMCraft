//! FE-17: Measure (ME, the Measure panel's) and Create Similar (CS) in a family's plans and elevations, as Revit's family
//! editor has them. Measure lays a ruler by two clicks, snapped as the Modify tools' points are, and reads it in the status
//! bar and over the view (its length, its angle from the view's across, and its parts across and up), changing nothing; the
//! ruler stays on show until the next first click, Escape or another tool, as the project's Measure does. Create Similar
//! starts the tool that makes the one thing selected, as it is: a form's Create (its kind, solid or void), Reference Plane for
//! a plane, the dimension tool of a dimension's kind, another symbol of a symbol's part, a connector of a connector's kind,
//! and Component with a nested instance's family and type. Neither is a step of the document's history.
