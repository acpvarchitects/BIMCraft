//! FE-5: shape handles on a selected form's profile, as Revit's. With one extrusion selected (solid or void) or a Blend (its
//! base), a plan or an elevation that sees its plane flat shows a handle at the middle of each edge of its profile, pointing out
//! of the solid; an elevation that sees an extrusion's plane edge-on shows one at mid-depth on each side it sees edge-on. A drag
//! offsets that edge along its normal, the lines at its ends following (`family::handles`), or changes an arc's radius: live,
//! one step of the document's history. An edge a lock, a labelled dimension or EQ holds, or whose numbers are formulas, is
//! greyed and refuses a drag, saying why; so does a drag that would leave no profile, or that the constraints would undo,
//! and the form is left as it was.
