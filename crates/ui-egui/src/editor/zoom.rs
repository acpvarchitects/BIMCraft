//! FE-3: Revit's zoom commands in the family document's views, through the window's own (`crate::zoom`). Each acts on the view
//! shown: a plan's or an elevation's frame (`Views::frames`), or {3D}'s camera (an adaptive family's modelling view's, else the
//! preview's). Zoom to Fit, Zoom Out (2x) and Zoom In Region each leave a step that Previous Pan/Zoom goes back to, a history of
//! each view; the wheel and the middle button leave none. Nothing here reaches the project's views.
