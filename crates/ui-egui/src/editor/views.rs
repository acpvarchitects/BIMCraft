//! F4: the family document's floor and ceiling plans and its four elevations, as Revit's family editor has them, beside
//! {3D}. Each is the project's own drawing of a scratch model the family stands in (`family::views`: its planes made project
//! reference planes there, mapped back by GUID), drawn on the interface's thread (a one-family model is small) and kept until
//! what it shows changes. In a family that isn't adaptive a click selects a form (its Properties, as T11) or a plane, a
//! selected plane of the family's own moves by a drag, and Reference Plane (RP) draws one by two clicks: upright in plan,
//! facing across an elevation. Work Plane Set and Show work over the planes. An adaptive family's plans and elevations show
//! its test placement and nothing more: its tools are in {3D}. What each view keeps (how close, where, its work plane) is the
//! session's, never the family's. Each view shows the family as the type previewed flexes it, and its dimensions, Aligned
//! Dimension and Align are F7's (`dimensions.rs`).
