//! FE-8: what is selected in a family's plan or elevation rotated, mirrored or scaled, as Revit's Modify panel does it. The
//! planes, reference lines and forms taken are drawn again where the transform puts them, in one go: a plane's ends and its
//! up (mirrored, its ends swapped, so its normal is the mirror image of what it was and what is drawn on it keeps its side),
//! a reference line's ends, a form's sketch and top in its host's axes. What is drawn on what is taken goes with it, as on a
//! move (FE-7). A form's numbers the transform changes are written as numbers; one that is a formula refuses it, as a move's
//! does. A mirrored arc turns the other way, and a mirrored revolve turns the other way round its axis.
//!
//! What stays, refusing it before anything is changed, is what stays on a move ([`Stays`]): a datum, a plane that defines the
//! origin, what a pivot turns, a form of a file's triangles, and what would leave the plane it is drawn on that isn't taken
//! too. Scale takes planes and reference lines alone (a form is sized by its dimensions and parameters, as Revit's Scale
//! leaves it), and Mirror leaves a sweep, whose profile would face the wrong way ([`TransformRefused`]).
//!
//! A dimension whose references are all taken goes with them. One that holds a constraint (a label, a lock, EQ, Align's lock)
//! between what is taken and what isn't would no longer hold, nor would a label or a lock of a length Scale changes: the
//! transform is refused as "Constraints are not satisfied", naming them ([`Unsat`]), which the front end asks about as Revit
//! does, Remove Constraints then doing it again.
