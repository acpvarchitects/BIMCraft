//! FE-7: what is selected in a family's plan or elevation moved together by a drag, as Revit moves it. The planes, reference
//! lines and forms moved are held where the move puts them (each unknown of theirs at where it is drawn plus the shift: a
//! plane along its normal, a line's start in the axes of what it is drawn on, a form's sketch in its host's axes and its
//! ends along its normal), those rows first; then every constraint of the family. What the constraints tie to what is moved
//! follows it where they let it (a form's line locked to a plane that moves goes with the plane); a constraint that would
//! have to change to let the move be (a lock, a label, EQ, an Align lock to what stays) holds it, and the move is refused,
//! naming it. Before the constraints are asked, what can't move at all is refused ([`Stays`]): a datum, a plane that defines
//! the origin, what a pivot turns, a number of a form's that the move would change and that is a formula, and what would
//! leave the plane it is drawn on (a revolve, a sweep or a reference line moved off it).
