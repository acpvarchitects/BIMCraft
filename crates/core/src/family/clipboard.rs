//! FE-14: the Family Editor's clipboard, as Revit's family editor has it. Copy to Clipboard (Ctrl+C) and Cut to Clipboard
//! (Ctrl+X) take what is selected ([`Family::clip`]); Paste (Ctrl+V) and Paste Aligned put copies of it back
//! ([`Family::paste`], [`Family::paste_into_view`]), each paste with new GUIDs of its own, so the clipboard pastes again and
//! again. The copies are FE-4's ([`Family::copies`]): what each is drawn on is the copy of it where that is copied too, else
//! what the original is drawn on; a dimension comes along where every reference of it is copied, one selected or one that
//! holds a constraint among the copies (a label, a lock, EQ, Align's lock), and one that ties what is copied to what isn't is
//! left behind ([`Clip::dropped`] counts those). What can't be copied (a datum, the plane that defines the origin, what a
//! pivot turns) refuses the copy as FE-4's does. The copies are held as a family of their own, apart from the document they
//! came from, so the clipboard stays what was copied whatever the document does after.
//!
//! The clipboard holds elements or, while a form is sketched, a sketch's lines ([`SketchClip`]): lines pasted into the same
//! sketch with new GUIDs, the locks and dimensions among them coming along and those to lines not copied dropped.
//!
//! Dimensions are drawn in a view (`DimView`): dimensions selected alone, measuring what isn't selected, are held as they are
//! ([`Clip::loose`]) and pasted into views (Aligned to Current View, Aligned to Selected Views), measuring the same references,
//! their labels, locks and EQ left behind, since those already hold in the view they were copied from.
//!
//! Nothing here is saved: the clipboard is the session's, no part of a family or a step of FORMAT.
